# Riddler
C# Practice based on FiveThirtyEight's Riddler Puzzle and associated problems

The problem can be summarized as:

IF  a = 1
    b = 2
    ...
    z = 26
    
What is the highest number less than the sum of its value spelled out?


ex. 

1 = one 

o = 15

n = 14

e = 5

one = 34
- Passes

1000 = one thousand = 136 
- Fails



The highest value less than its spelled out self is: 279
